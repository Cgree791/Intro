# ðŸ‘‹ About Me  
Hi, Iâ€™m Clayton J. Green. Iâ€™m a passionate developer skilled in Python, JavaScript, Java, HTML, and CSS. I have certifications in Python and web development. Iâ€™m currently learning app development to expand my skills even more. I also know how to build and fix PCs, laptops, phones, tablets, and printers. All my coding projects are organized and shared on GitHub.

I love cats, anime, and gaming. They keep me inspired and motivated. I am very organized and outgoing. I enjoy working with others but also value focused solo time. I am proficient in all Microsoft 365 apps including Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, OneNote, Publisher, Access, Teams, and OneDrive.

Coding is a mix of creativity and problem solving for me. I am always eager to learn and grow in this fast-changing field.
